# RUL_Prediction_Benchmarking
Deep Learning in Time Series Forecasting

This repository contains the experiments done in the work "Benchmarking of Regression and Classification Deep Learning Methods in Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Structures Subject to Fatigue" by Akrim Anass, Gogu Christian, Guillebot de Nerville Thomas, Strähle Paul, Waffa Pagou Brondon, Salaün Michel and Vingerhoeds Rob.

This repository contains :

1) The code for synthetically generating datasets, simulating the fatigue crack growth that can be used in PHM, allowing to test the Machine Learning techniques (especially Deep Neural Networks) on large amounts of labeled data.
2) Training codes for the methods proposed in our work, in order to allow reproducibility.

# Setup

This code was tested on Python 3.8.5, Pandas 0.25.1, Ubuntu 18.04, Anaconda 4.7.11, Tensorflow version 2.3.0, and CUDA 11.0. It requires V100 GPUs.
